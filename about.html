    <h2>About my major</h2>
    <p>
        I chose my major because I am really interested in the spread of information and how it affects our lives. When I started at MSU, I was a computer science major. I hadn't known about Information Science yet, all I knew was that Comp Sci made $$$! But when I started to learn more about Info Sci and what it has to offer, I was hooked!
